# MiniVentures Repository

Welcome to the MiniVentures repository! Here you'll find a collection of fun and useful projects created by me. Currently, the repository hosts three projects, with more exciting projects planned for the future.

## Projects

### Hangman

Hangman is a basic project implemented using only JavaScript. Test your word-guessing skills with this classic game!

### MovieApp

MovieApp fetches movie details from an API and displays them based on keywords entered by the user. Explore information about your favorite movies with ease!

### WeatherApp

WeatherApp shows the current weather conditions of a mentioned city. Recently, PHP support was added to enable server-side data storage, allowing the app to display weather data for the previous 7 days.

## Hosting

All projects in this repository are hosted using GitHub Pages.
